**Appendix**

**Glossary of Crochet Terms:**

*   **Blocking:** A process of wetting or steaming a finished crochet piece to shape it, even out stitches, and enhance the drape. It's especially important for lace and garments.
*   **Chain (ch):** The foundation of most crochet projects, formed by a series of interconnected loops.
*   **Cluster:** A group of stitches worked together into the same stitch or space, creating a textured effect.
*   **Decrease (dec):** Combining two or more stitches together to reduce the stitch count and narrow the fabric.
*   **Double Crochet (dc):** A basic crochet stitch that creates a more open fabric than single crochet.  It's taller than a half double crochet.
*   **FO (Finished Object):** A completed crochet project.
*   **Frog/Frogging:**  The act of unraveling your crochet work, usually because of a mistake.  (The term comes from the "rip-it, rip-it" sound, which resembles a frog's croak).
*   **Gauge:** The number of stitches and rows per inch (or centimeter) achieved with a specific yarn, hook, and stitch pattern.  Matching the pattern's gauge is crucial for projects where size matters.
*  **Granny Square:** A classic crochet motif, typically square, made by working in rounds from the center outwards. Granny squares can be joined to create blankets, garments, and other items.
*   **Half Double Crochet (hdc):** A basic crochet stitch that is taller than a single crochet but shorter than a double crochet.
*   **Increase (inc):** Adding stitches to expand the fabric's width.  This is often done by working two or more stitches into the same stitch.
*   **Magic Ring (also called Magic Circle):** An adjustable loop used to begin crocheting in the round, creating a tight center with no hole.
*   **Picot:** A small decorative loop, often used as an edging or embellishment, especially in lace crochet.
*    **Shell:** A group of stitches (usually double crochet stitches) worked into the same stitch or space, creating a fan-like or shell-like shape.
*   **Single Crochet (sc):** The most basic crochet stitch, creating a dense and sturdy fabric.
*   **Slip Stitch (sl st):** A very short stitch used for joining rounds, creating edges, or moving the yarn across a row without adding height. It has almost no height.
*   **Stash:** A crocheter's personal collection of yarn.
*   **Treble Crochet (tr) (also called Triple Crochet):** A tall crochet stitch that creates a very open and airy fabric.  It's taller than a double crochet.
*   **WIP (Work in Progress):** An unfinished crochet project.
*   **Yarn Over (yo):** The act of wrapping the yarn around the crochet hook.
