"To all who pick up a hook and yarn, to those who find solace in the rhythm of stitches, and to the artists who create with their hearts:

These books are dedicated to you. May they be a source of inspiration, a guide in your creative journey, and a testament to the beautiful things we can make when we pour our love into our craft.
